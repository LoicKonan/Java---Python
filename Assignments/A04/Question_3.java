 * Label:       Question 3
 * Title:       Programing Assignment 01
 * Course:      CMPS 4143 
 * Semester:    Fall 2021
 * 
 * Description:
 *              This Project is about Finding the 5 highest frequency words using
 *              several array operations.
 * 
 * Solution: 
 *             I used some built-in function then took my given string and inserted
 *             it in an array, then use a for loop to iterate through it and remove
 *             anything that wasnâ€™t a text, then use another for loop and if statement
 *             to compare each element to see which one appeared more 
 *             and then printed it to the console.
