## Program 02 -  Problem Solving.

### Description

> **1.** Write an **OOP code** (A case study: Should be unique) that has the following OOP features:
>
> - **inheritance(any).**
> - **polymorphism (runtime and compile time).**
> - **abstraction.**
> - **encapsulation.**
>
> **2.** Consider the following organigram (can be found: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal> ) of **Mammalia family**. (a: 5, b: 5, c: 10, d: 20, e:10)

>
> - a. Each of members:
>   - i. has:
>
>       1. **Legs (count)**
>       2. **Tails (yes/no)**
>       3. **Brain (yes/no)**
>       4. **Neurons (count)**
>       5. **Precision to understand (0.00 to 100.00%)**
>       6. **Birth date**
>       7. **Favorite foods**
>
> ii. can
> 1. Eat
> 2. Walk
> 3. Sleep
> 4. Give Birth
> b. Think about perissodactyla, they can mate with carnivora members; can breed and produce a new family called ‘Perivora’. Perivora animals supposed to > give birth to a new family ‘Periveron’. But by nature law no periveron member can be crated.
> c. Create at least 5 animals from each family; Perviveron member cannot be produced.
> d. Now you can do some creativity by changing the neurons, precision to understand, food habits, but you can’t change the legs, brains, birth date.
> Change these features for at least 20 animals and show how it was before and how it is now. From level 6 to 8(Considering Mammlia as level-1 and 
> carnivora, cetartiodactyla are on level-8), animals can run and hunt for their food. Change at least 10 animals’ running speed, hunting process and > hunting food type for those who are 6-8 level animals. Try changing at least 10 animals and show (reading from files; see next bullet) what they were and > what they are now.
> e. All outcomes should be stored in a file. When you have created objects, their information should be stored in files. After changing their behaviors 
> and attributes, they should also be stored in files. The term show mentioned in the previous sub-section refers to reading the data from files and 
> printing to the console.
>
> **3.** Create a calculator class which can perform certain operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. Now, add Java > exception handling to your code by defining two exception classes SyntaxError and RuntimeError. A SyntaxError exception should be thrown when an illegal > character is found, a closing ) is not found, or a = is not used twice in an expression or an unwanted alphanumeric character inside the equation. A > RuntimeError > exception should be thrown when a divide by zero occurs. The exceptions should propagate the error to the main program which prints the > diagnostics of the > error. You must handle these errors using Java exceptions and the message should be printed by a Java exception handler in a catch > clause.
