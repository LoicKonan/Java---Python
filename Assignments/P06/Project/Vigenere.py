		key lengths of the key that the cipher text was encrypted with. For this
		program, we are testing a key length of 2 all the way to a potential key
		length of 16. The testing calculates the I.O.C value of a key length which involves 
		splitting the cipher text into sequences according to the key length. If a key
		length is 2, we turn the cipher text into two sequences, alternating every other
		character and then these are stored in a list and sent to the Cryptomath
		method. After that method call is complete, the loop iterates, and the next
		possible key length is tested.

        Method is directly called from the Index of Coincidence method and receives a
		slcies list object that has the separate slices of sequences according to the key
        length that is being tested. The testing process involves counting the instances 
        of letters occuring more than once in the slices instance tfrom the last method. 
        This eventually results in an Index of Coincidence value such as: 0.048. Once 
		completed, the IOC value is stored in a list of dictionary objects that will be
        sorted later by this value. The highest score indicates the most "English Like"
        and therefore that is the most likely key length to begin the dictionary attack on.

            Method is responsible for utilizing the results of the most likely key
            lengths, and eventually performing a dictionary attack on the cipher.
            This is of course assuming that the key that was used to encrypt the cipher
            is a dictionary word. A list of words from the dictionary file are read in 
            and then a narrowed version is created by appending words that are equal to 
            the key length we are testing. This helps us eliminate the majority of
            the dictionary words and limit it to only words that are of the key length.

            Once this is completed, the method will brute force every shift combination
            of this narrowed list of dictionary words and pass the result to the Score Results
            method and determine the result.

            The score Results method is nearly identical to the Index of Coincidence
            method and in fact share most of the same code. The only difference is that
            the I.O.C method is testing key lengths are therefore is splitting the message
            into sequences and testing each sequence. Since we are testing the whole message
            and not key lengths, we skip the sequence splitting part and just test the 
            message using the same math. Whichever result scores the highest is updated and
            eventually once the process is done, ideally, the highest scoring result should be
            the correct result and is the most English-like.

            I say ideally because this caveat will be discussed in class as the I.O.C is much
            more reliable when it has more text to work with. On larger results, this calculation
            is bulletproof reliable. However, on shorter sample sizes, it is not always 100% and
            in fact non-English-Like results can score higher than the actual correct result.

    Helper Function to strip out key arguments that are passed in 
    when running the program            

    Processes argv list into plain args (list) and kwargs (dict).
    Just easier than using a library like argparse for small things.
    Example:
        python file.py arg1 arg2 arg3=val1 arg4=val2 -arg5 -arg6 --arg7
        Would create:
            args[arg1, arg2, -arg5, -arg6, --arg7]
            kargs{arg3 : val1, arg4 : val2}

        Params with dashes (flags) can now be processed seperately
    Shortfalls:
        spaces between k=v would result in bad params
        Flags aren't handled at all. Maybe in the future but this function
            is meant to be simple.
