 # Title:           Programing Assignment 03 
 # Course:          CMPS 4143 
 # Semester:        Fall 2021 
 # Date:            10/20/2021

 # Description:     
 #                  This program will asks the user to enter the number of people, 
 #                  then based on this number it will iterate that amount of time  
 #                  where each time it will get a single personâ€™s information 
 #                  like First Name, then Last Name, Age, Occupation and Address.
 #                  Then finally it will Display the user details one by one.
 # 
 # Solution:        
 #                  Used Lists to preserve the sequence of my data and for my iteration.           
 #                  Made a List for each information that the user entered.         
 #                  I then use if statement to to validate the information entered.
 #                  I use the regex to validate the addres.
