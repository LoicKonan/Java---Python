## Assignment 05 - Interface in Java 

### Loic Konan

### Description

- Like a class, an **interface** can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by default **abstract (only method signature, no body)**.
- **Interfaces** specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
- If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then the class must be declared **abstract**.
  
    > - Example of vehicles like bicycle, car, bike………, they have common functionalities.
    > - So we make an interface and put all these common functionalities. And lets Bicycle,
    > - Bike, car ….etc implement all these functionalities in their own class in their own way.
